Instructions for the setup the Simulator.



INSTALLATION

- Clone the git repository
- Enter in the folder "SFAV"
- Create a folder called "build" and enter into it
- Execute the command "cmake .."
- Execute the command "make"



CONFIGURATION

/* On the simulator machine */
This file contains configuration parameters related to the basic components and the communication links between components. In the configuration file is possible to set information about:
- The "home" position
- The communication with the Ground Station
- The communication with the Unreal Environment engine
- Each communication link with an autopilot (at the moment only the PX4 autopilot is supported)

Some example configuration files are available in the folder "Config_Files".


/* On the board */
In the configuration file set IP and ports to start the Mavlink communication with the simulator machine.
E.g., mavlink start -o 4002 -u 4003 -t 10.30.3.109 -r 1000000, where the parameters which could be to change are
4002: the remote port on the simulator
4003: is the local port on the autopilot
10.30.3.109: IP address of the machine running the simulation framework 

Some example configuration files are available in the folder "Config_Files".


/* On Unreal Engine */
Create the new pawns and set up the configuration for the communication component following the related procedure.



TODO
 
- As far as the Synthetic Environment is considered, the possibility to set up the initial position has not been implemented yet. All the pawn are spawned in the origin of the map. 
- As far as the autopilot is considered, only the PX4 software is supported. Managing other Mavlink-based autopilots is under consideration.
